      <h3 class="heading">What does your company offer versus the competitors?</h3>
      <p class="subheading">We offer a proprietary subscriptions-based cyber security solution that opens up opportunities to a wide range of businesses. Opening not only cost-effective security, but an in depth community and user base.</p>
      <h3 class="heading">How does urgent threat escalation work?</h3>
      <p class="subheading">Urgent Threat Escalation (UTE) is a system in which technicians are on standby to respond to tickets and through a help desk phone line.</p>
      <h3 class="heading">I've Purchased a Subscription, What's Next?</h3>
      <p class="subheading">Once a subscription plan is purchased, you will be sent a confirmation email that allows users to set up a consultation meeting with a technician. From here a technician will walk you through the next steps of installing, protecting, and adding your system.</p>
      <h3 class="heading">What systems are supported?</h3>
      <p class="subheading">Almost all systems and hardware are supported by our software. Depending on the subscription plan purchased, you will be offered a wide range of distributions of our proprietary software to ensure all of your systems can be supported.</p>
      <h3 class="heading">Through your service, are my devices insured?</h3>
      <p class="subheading">We cannot physically ensure any hardware infrastructure. However, our data loss protection is included in the Business Prime and Enterprise Elite plans that allows insurance that if any data is compromised or lost while active, your plan can be refunded in full.</p>
